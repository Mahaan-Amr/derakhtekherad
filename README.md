## Authentication

The application uses a dual authentication system:

2. **Token-based authentication** for API requests

For API requests that require authentication (like creating/editing posts or categories), you need to:
- Be logged in as an admin user, or
- Include the authorization token in request headers:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer [your-jwt-token]
  ```

The JWT tokens are properly validated using the `jose` library with secure verification.
