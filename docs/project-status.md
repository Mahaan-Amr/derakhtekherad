## Current Priorities

1. Complete Student Dashboard with assignment view
2. Create Student Assignment Submission system
3. Develop Notification system for new assignments and grades
4. Add Student Performance Analytics
5. Improve SEO and metadata for public pages

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Replacing Mock Data with Real-time Analytics
- **Description**: Needed to transition from mock data to real-time database statistics in admin dashboard.
- **Solution**: Created dedicated API endpoints for statistics that calculate metrics from actual database records, implemented proper caching and optimization to maintain performance.

### Challenge: TypeScript Errors in Database Seed Script
- **Description**: Multiple type-related issues in the seed script causing compilation errors.
- **Solution**: Fixed incorrect table references, added proper type annotations for random date generation, ensured required fields have values, and implemented proper error handling for database operations.

### Challenge: TypeScript Errors in Fetch Interceptors
- **Description**: TypeScript errors when trying to set `Authorization` headers in fetch interceptors.
- **Solution**: Used type assertions (`as Record<string, string>`) to properly type the headers object, allowing for setting custom headers while maintaining type safety.

### Challenge: Student Roster Data Organization
- **Description**: Needed to efficiently aggregate student data across multiple courses for teacher dashboard.
- **Solution**: Implemented optimized database queries that join student, enrollment, and course data, then used server-side aggregation to calculate statistics before sending to client.

### Challenge: Framer Motion Server Components
- **Description**: Framer Motion components were failing to render due to being used in a server component.
- **Solution**: Added 'use client' directive to pages using Framer Motion to ensure proper client-side rendering.

### Challenge: Images in Internationalized Routes
- **Description**: Next.js was adding locale prefixes to image URLs, causing 404 errors (e.g., `/fa/uploads/image.jpg`).
- **Solution**: Updated the middleware to exclude static asset paths from locale prefixing, allowing images to load correctly from the public directory.

### Challenge: Dual Authentication
- **Description**: The project requires support for both server-side authentication (NextAuth.js) and client-side token-based authentication (custom JWT).
- **Solution**: Implemented a dual authentication approach where API routes check for both authentication methods:
  1. First check for Bearer token in Authorization header
  2. If not available, fall back to NextAuth session
  3. Frontend components retrieve and include the token in API requests
  4. User creation handled automatically if needed

### Challenge: JWT Token Validation
- **Description**: Token validation was failing due to incorrect comparison of tokens.
- **Solution**: Implemented proper JWT verification using the jose library, verifying the signature instead of comparing the raw token.

### Challenge: Styling and CSS Processing
- **Description**: Issues with PostCSS configuration causing styles not to load properly.
- **Solution**: Updated PostCSS configuration from ES Module format to CommonJS format for better compatibility.

### Challenge: Image Optimization
- **Description**: Next.js Image component throwing errors for remote images.
- **Solution**: Updated the image configuration to use remotePatterns instead of deprecated domains.

## Conclusion

Derakhte Kherad has established a solid foundation with a working authentication system, internationalization support, responsive UI, role-specific dashboards, and a complete blog system with both admin and public interfaces. Recent enhancements to the consultation page with Framer Motion animations demonstrate the project's commitment to providing an engaging user experience. The focus now shifts to implementing additional features, enhancing the user interface, improving the overall user experience, and resolving remaining build issues before preparing for production deployment.

## Teacher Dashboard Implementation Plan

### Overview
The Teacher Dashboard will enable teachers to manage their courses, students, and assignments efficiently. Based on our review of the existing codebase, we have a basic teacher dashboard structure in place with placeholder data, but no actual functionality or dedicated pages beyond the main dashboard view.

### Implementation Tasks

#### 1. Teacher Courses Management
- Create a courses page at `app/[locale]/teacher/courses`
- Implement `CoursesList` component to display teacher's assigned courses
- Add course details view with student enrollment information
- Implement course statistics and progress tracking
- Create API endpoints for teacher-specific course operations

#### 2. Student Roster Management
- Create a students page at `app/[locale]/teacher/students`
- Implement `StudentsList` component to show students enrolled in teacher's courses
- Add student performance tracking and attendance records
- Create detailed student view with progress across assignments
- Implement API endpoints for teacher access to student data

#### 3. Assignment Management
- Create an assignments page at `app/[locale]/teacher/assignments`
- Implement `AssignmentsList` component to manage course assignments
- Create `AssignmentEditor` component for creating and editing assignments
- Implement submission review and grading functionality
- Develop API endpoints for assignment CRUD operations

#### 4. Grading System
- Implement grading interface for assignment submissions
- Create grade overview and reporting for students
- Add feedback functionality for assignments
- Implement API endpoints for submission grading

### API Requirements
The following API endpoints will need to be implemented:
- `/api/assignments` - CRUD operations for assignments
- `/api/submissions` - Manage and grade student submissions
- Enhanced endpoints for teacher-specific queries:
  - `/api/courses/teacher` - Courses assigned to the current teacher
  - `/api/students/course` - Students enrolled in a specific course

### Component Structure
- `TeacherCoursesManagement.tsx` - Main component for courses management
- `TeacherStudentsManagement.tsx` - Main component for student roster
- `AssignmentsManagement.tsx` - Main component for assignment handling
- `SubmissionGrader.tsx` - Component for grading submissions
- Supporting smaller components for lists, forms, and detail views

### Authentication and Authorization
All teacher dashboard features will use the existing dual authentication system (JWT + NextAuth) with role-based access control to ensure only authorized teachers can access their own data.

### Database Schema
The existing Prisma schema already includes the necessary models (`Teacher`, `Course`, `Assignment`, `Submission`), so no schema changes are required for the basic implementation.
