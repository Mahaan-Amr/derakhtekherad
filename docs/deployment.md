# Deployment Roadmap for Derakhte Kherad LMS

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Derakhte Kherad Learning Management System, including CI/CD setup, hosting options, and production deployment steps.

## 1. Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
- **Pros**: 
  - Seamless integration with Next.js
  - Automatic preview deployments
  - Built-in CI/CD
  - Edge network for fast content delivery
  - Free tier available for testing
- **Cons**:
  - May require premium plans for team collaboration
  - Database needs to be hosted separately

### Option 2: Self-hosted or VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure)
- **Pros**:
  - Complete control over infrastructure
  - Can host both application and database
  - Potentially more cost-effective for larger applications
- **Cons**:
  - Requires DevOps knowledge
  - Manual configuration of CI/CD
  - Need to manage scaling and uptime

## 2. CI/CD Setup

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file with:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, development ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, development ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Type check
        run: npm run type-check
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-output
          path: .next/

  deploy-staging:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/development'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-output
          path: .next/
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        # Add deployment steps here for your staging environment

  deploy-production:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-output
          path: .next/
      - name: Deploy to Production
        # Add deployment steps here for your production environment
```

### Vercel Integration

If using Vercel, you can simplify the workflow by:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure automatic deployments:
   - Production: main branch
   - Preview: development branch and pull requests
3. Set up environment variables in the Vercel dashboard

## 3. Database Setup

### PostgreSQL Hosting Options:
- **Supabase**: Excellent PostgreSQL platform with user authentication
- **Railway**: Simple deployment, good free tier
- **Neon**: Serverless PostgreSQL database
- **AWS RDS/Azure Database for PostgreSQL**: Enterprise-grade options

Steps:
1. Create a production database instance
2. Set up database backups
3. Configure connection pooling for production load
4. Set up a separate staging database
5. Run migrations using Prisma:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

## 4. Environment Configuration

Create appropriate `.env` files for different environments:

### `.env.local` (Development)
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/derakhtekherad"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-development-secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
# Other development variables
```

### `.env.production` (Production)
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@production-db-host:5432/derakhtekherad"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-production-domain.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-production-secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://your-production-domain.com"
# Other production variables
```

## 5. Production Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository set up
- CI/CD pipeline configured
- Production database provisioned
- Domain name registered and configured

### Deployment Steps

1. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Set up production database
   - Configure DNS for your domain
   - Set up CDN (if not using Vercel)

2. **Application Preparation**:
   - Ensure all type errors are fixed
   - Verify build success locally
   - Review all environment variables

3. **Initial Deployment**:
   - Push to main branch (triggering deployment)
   - Monitor CI/CD pipeline for successful build
   - Check deployment logs

4. **Database Migration**:
   - Run production database migrations:
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate deploy
     ```
   - Optionally seed initial data:
     ```bash
     npx prisma db seed
     ```

5. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Test all critical user flows on production
   - Verify authentication works correctly
   - Test admin dashboard functionality
   - Check responsiveness on mobile devices
   - Verify network performance

6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Set up error monitoring (Sentry is recommended)
   - Configure performance monitoring
   - Set up automated backups
   - Establish regular update schedule

## 6. Security Considerations

- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Implement rate limiting for API routes
- Configure CORS properly
- Set up appropriate Content Security Policy
- Regularly update dependencies
- Implement proper user role validation
- Consider JWT token rotation
- Secure file uploads with validation

## 7. Performance Optimization

- Implement server caching strategies
- Optimize images and static assets
- Use CDN for static content delivery
- Configure service worker for offline capability
- Review and optimize database queries
- Implement pagination for large data sets

## 8. Scaling Considerations

- Monitor database performance
- Implement horizontal scaling if needed
- Configure auto-scaling rules
- Consider serverless functions for API routes
- Implement Redis for session store in high-traffic scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Set up the CI/CD pipeline
2. Create production database
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run a test deployment
5. Set up monitoring
6. Document deployment process for team members
