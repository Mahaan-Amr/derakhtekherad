LOGO PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

To update the site logo:

1. Save your logo file as "logo.png" in this directory (public/site-logo/)
2. The recommended logo size is 512x512 pixels
3. Make sure your logo has a transparent background
4. The display size will be automatically adjusted to fit the header

Do NOT rename this file or change its location, as it will break the site's header.

If you need to replace the logo, simply overwrite this file with your new logo.
No cache-busting or other special handling is required.
