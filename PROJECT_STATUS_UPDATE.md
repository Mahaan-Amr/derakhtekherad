## Technical Implementation Details

### Course Level Enhancement

```typescript
// Updated level options in CourseEditor
const levelOptions = ['A1.1', 'A1.2', 'A2.1', 'A2.2', 'B1.1', 'B1.2', 'B2.1', 'B2.2', 'C1.1', 'C1.2', 'C2.1', 'C2.2'];

// Updated level display in LanguageLevelSection
levels: {
  a1: locale === 'de' ? 'Anfänger (A1.1-A1.2)' : 'مبتدی (A1.1-A1.2)',
  b1: locale === 'de' ? 'Mittelstufe (B1.1-B1.2)' : 'متوسط (B1.1-B1.2)',
  c1: locale === 'de' ? 'Fortgeschritten (C1.1-C1.2)' : 'پیشرفته (C1.1-C1.2)'
}
```

### Price Display Localization

```typescript
// Updated price formatting in CourseCard
const formatPrice = (price: number) => {
  // Format number with comma separators
  const formattedNumber = new Intl.NumberFormat(locale === 'de' ? 'de-DE' : 'fa-IR', {
    minimumFractionDigits: 0,
    maximumFractionDigits: 0
  }).format(price);
  
  // Add the appropriate currency text
  return locale === 'de' 
    ? `${formattedNumber} Toman` 
    : `${formattedNumber} تومان`;
};
```

## Impact and Benefits

These improvements have:

1. **Enhanced Educational Alignment**: The sublevel system (A1.1, A1.2, etc.) better aligns with standard language proficiency levels
2. **Improved User Experience**: Localized currency display makes prices more intuitive for users
3. **Better Regional Relevance**: Using Toman/تومان ensures the platform meets local market expectations
4. **Increased Precision**: Sublevels provide more granular course categorization for students at different learning stages

## Next Steps

1. Complete student dashboard implementation
2. Implement student assignment submission system
3. Develop notification system for new assignments and grades
4. Continue enhancing user experience across the platform

## Overview

This document provides an update on the latest fixes and improvements made to the Derakhte Kherad Learning Management System. These updates primarily focus on fixing CRUD functionality for blog posts and courses, enhancing authentication, and improving error handling.

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### Blog System Fixes

1. **Post Deletion Across Models**
   - Fixed the blog post deletion functionality to handle both `Post` and `BlogPost` models
   - Implemented a dual-check system that searches in both models before returning "not found"
   - Added proper model detection to delete from the correct table

2. **Authentication Enhancements**
   - Added support for both session-based and token-based authentication
   - Implemented proper checks in blog API routes to allow both authentication methods
   - Added credentials to all API requests to ensure session cookies are sent

3. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Added detailed logging with context labels (e.g., `[Blog API]`)
   - Enhanced error messages to provide more specific information
   - Implemented more robust error handling in client components

4. **Client-Side Compatibility**
   - Fixed the `PostEditor` component to handle both `Post` and `BlogPost` models
   - Added proper type definitions and fallbacks for model differences
   - Implemented optional chaining and null checks to prevent runtime errors

### Course Management Fixes

1. **Hierarchical Deletion**
   - Implemented a step-by-step deletion process for courses and all related data
   - Created a proper order for deleting related records to avoid foreign key constraint errors:
     1. Materials → Lessons → Modules 
     2. Quiz Responses → Quiz Questions → Quizzes
     3. Submissions → Assignments
     4. Enrollments
     5. The course itself

2. **Authentication Fixes**
   - Fixed the authentication in course API routes with support for both session and token
   - Added proper admin checks before allowing deletion operations
   - Enhanced error handling for unauthorized attempts

3. **Client-Side Improvements**
   - Added credentials to API requests in the course management components
   - Enhanced logging to track the deletion process
   - Improved error handling to show detailed error information

4. **Database Safety**
   - Added checks to verify course existence before attempting to delete
   - Implemented proper error handling for database operations
   - Added transaction support where needed to ensure data consistency

## Technical Implementation Details

### Blog Post Deletion Improvements

```typescript
// Check if post exists in either model
let existingPost;
let useNewModel = false;

try {
  // First try the regular Post model
  existingPost = await prisma.post.findUnique({
    where: { id }
  });
  
  // If not found, try the BlogPost model
  if (!existingPost) {
    console.log('[Blog API] Post not found in Post model, trying BlogPost model');
    const blogPost = await prisma.blogPost.findUnique({
      where: { id }
    });
    
    if (blogPost) {
      useNewModel = true;
      existingPost = blogPost;
      console.log('[Blog API] Found post in BlogPost model');
    }
  }
} catch (findError) {
  console.error('[Blog API] Error finding post:', findError);
}
```

### Course Deletion Improvements

```typescript
// Delete all related records in order to avoid foreign key constraint issues

// 1. Delete all material resources first (deepest level)
for (const module of course.modules) {
  for (const lesson of module.lessons) {
    if (lesson.materials.length > 0) {
      console.log(`[Courses API] Deleting ${lesson.materials.length} materials for lesson ${lesson.id}`);
      await prisma.material.deleteMany({
        where: { lessonId: lesson.id }
      });
    }
  }
}

// 2. Delete all lessons
for (const module of course.modules) {
  if (module.lessons.length > 0) {
    console.log(`[Courses API] Deleting ${module.lessons.length} lessons for module ${module.id}`);
    await prisma.lesson.deleteMany({
      where: { moduleId: module.id }
    });
  }
}

// Continue with other related data...
```

### Authentication Improvements

```typescript
// Check for authentication
const { isAuthenticated, userId } = await authenticate(request);

if (!isAuthenticated) {
  console.error('[Courses API] Not authenticated');
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Not authenticated' },
    { status: 401 }
  );
}

// Check if the user is an admin
const admin = await prisma.admin.findFirst({
  where: {
    userId: userId || undefined
  }
});
```

### Client-Side API Request Improvements

```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/courses/${id}`, {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
  credentials: 'include', // Include session cookies
});
```

## Impact and Benefits

These fixes and improvements have:

1. **Enhanced Reliability**: Made CRUD operations more robust, especially deletion
2. **Improved Debugging**: Added detailed logging for easier troubleshooting
3. **Strengthened Security**: Enhanced authentication checks across API routes
4. **Improved User Experience**: Fixed errors that were causing operation failures
5. **Better Maintainability**: Standardized error handling and logging patterns

## Conclusion

The recent fixes have significantly improved the stability and reliability of the Derakhte Kherad Learning Management System, particularly in the blog and course management areas. The enhanced error handling and logging will make future debugging easier, while the improved authentication ensures that the system remains secure.
